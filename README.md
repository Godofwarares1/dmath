A series of functions I created to solve Project Euler questions extremely quickly.\

The main goal of this repo is to try and solve the first 10 problems on project Euler in less that 0.1 seconds. Problem 1 and 2 are done but I am still trying to uncover a faster way to find prime factors. right now I am trying to wrap my head around a quadratic sieve.
